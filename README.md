# DC-Path-Visualizer
Visualizer for DC or any Network Topology

Very basic python code to create Network topology using NetworkX, matplotlib, mplcursors
Have excluded the code to collect the data from various sources to create the network relationships

It supports 
------------
* Multi level networks
* Static placement of nodes
* Dynamic tooltip for nodes (for Node Health / Stats)
* Node and Edge color coding (for Node / Link Health)
* Edge labels
* Node labels 

Todo:  Edge Tooltip (for Link Health)

Ideally all these should be dynamically generated for live deployment

Assembled from various stackoverflow docs and Networkx documentation
