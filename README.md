# DC-Path-Visualizer
Visualizer for DC or any Network Topology

Very basic python code to create Network topology using NetworkX, matplotlib, mplcursors
Have excluded the code to collect the data from various sources to create the network relationships

It supports 
------------
Markup : * Multi level networks
* Static placement of nodes
* Dynamic tooltip for nodes
* Node and edge color coding
* Edge labels
* Node labels

Ideally all these should be dynamically generated for live deployment

Assembled from various stackoverflow docs and Networkx documentation
